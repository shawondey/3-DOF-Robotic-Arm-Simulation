# 3-DOF-Robotic-Arm-Simulation
This project presents a manipulation of a 3 link robotic arm joints and trajectory control scheme for a 3-link planar manipulator. The manipulator is simulated with the general equations of motion along with the provided boundary conditions. Forward Kinematics equations were the base equations of motions to manipulate the robotic arm in the workspace. The regional work-space and limit of the manipulator forces the robotic arm to shake infinitely. In order to control and make the arm in the steady state position, least damped square function is considered for minimum vibration position. The damping factor is 0.3 is considered the most suitable for this particular 3-link manipulator. Different observations are made through limiting the joint constraints varying the angle of the joints.
